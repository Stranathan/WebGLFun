Just a little toy/ game jam-ish thing for the weekend.

Try it out [here](https://www.ianstranathan.com/projects/justForFun/farbenSpiel/farbenSpiel.html).  

The idea was to try to match a certain gradient in the center circle of a set of circularly packed circles, using adjacent circle color combinations.
It's kinda neat in the sense that it's pretty self contained in a single fragment shader a'la shadertoy.
Convoluted, unoptimized and unfinished as usual.
