Just a little toy/ prototype for a mobile game idea I had. 
The idea was to try to match a certain gradient in the center circle of a set of circularly packed circles, using adjacent circle color combinations.
It's kinda neat in the sense that it's pretty self contained in a single fragment shader a'la shadertoy.
Convoluted and unoptimized as always, but was a fun, game jam-ish thing to practice shaders over the weekend.
